Growing up as the child of immigrant parents, I had to learn many languages from a young age. That's why I was thrilled when I discovered that I could use computers to translate languages in the early 2010s. As a trilingual individual (English, Finnish, Chinese) who has studied 5 languages during her lifetime, I've always been fascinated by the structure of languages, and how we transform words into meanings in different languages. It was a revelation to realize that this interest could intersect with the field of data science, particularly in natural language processing, which at its core seeks to bridge human communication and machine understanding, a challenge that resonates deeply with my personal experiences in language acquisition and translation. 

Outside of natural language processing, I'm also really interested in translating big data into digestable narratives. After graduation, I worked in consulting and tech industry as a data analyst helping companies automate their data processing pipelines (using Python and SQL), and conduct statistical analyses (e.g A/B testing, propensity score modeling, regression analyses) to drive business decisions and build better products. My experience in consulting helped me work with various individuals with different professional and personal backgrounds. 

Hungry for more knowledge, I went back to complete my master's in data science at Duke University with a focus in deep learning and statistical inference. Outside of my interest for data and machine learning, I enjoy producing music and making pottery!
